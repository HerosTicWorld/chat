⚡# CFX Chat by Heros

This change allows you to stop showing all entries in your chat:

You will no longer see information like, a player has logged in/logged out/died...etc
You will no longer see what other players write

But you will see what you write and you can still use it to type commands or other, only it does not appear in the box once activated!
It only displays for the player who opens it and entries do not display publicly.

For nice ergonomics and more fun, you can add it to my chat_theme: https://github.com/HerosTicWorld/heros_chat_theme


🔄 # Installation

Just replace your chat folder inside the CFX files

-- >resources/cfx/gameplay/chat (redemrp-reboot2023 or vorp)
-- >resources/gameplay/chat (redemrp-old)

So you have to delete the one in your default folder of server-data files and in your artifact !


📛 Save your old folder if you need to take it back !
